# 6502 Emulator
- This is a 6502 emulator that I'll be using for my NES emulator. 
- Written in C++, focusing on writing clean and well documented code. 



## Things Done
- Made the memory
- made registers
- made execute function
- Did a Computer architecture Class
- Was able to get LDA instructions working up until the Absolute address, x mode
- Understand PC register
- understand clock cycles and how to implement it

## Things to-do
- understand what page crossing is (I'm guessing it's if you access another page, I dunno)
- Implement the other instructions
- Develop software to test instructions (VASM? Bytewriting program?)
- Get the file reading function to work
- comment the code (never finished)
- clean it up
	- Want to complete the LDA instructions, than think about implement function pointers.
		- Allows for cleaner code.
